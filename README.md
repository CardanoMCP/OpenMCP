# OpenMCP Cardano: Enabling AI-Ready On-Chain Data Access

## Introduction
Welcome to OpenMCP Cardano!

OpenMCP (Model Context Protocol) for Cardano is an open standard protocol designed to create a seamless bridge between Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, including Large Language Models (LLMs), and Cardano's complex on-chain data ecosystem.

This project aims to address the fundamental barrier of complexity and fragmentation in on-chain data access, allowing AI to easily understand, process, and leverage the rich data on the Cardano blockchain.

By converting complex on-chain data into semantic formats that AI can understand, OpenMCP Cardano will open a new era of AI-native decentralized applications (dApps) and intelligent data analytics on the Cardano network.

## The Problem We're Solving
Currently, the Cardano ecosystem is thriving, but the potential for AI integration is being hindered by a fundamental barrier: the complexity and fragmentation of on-chain data access. Cardano lacks a standard protocol that allows AI models to understand on-chain data, leading to the following issues:

- Lack of Standardization: There is no common protocol or format to represent the "context" of on-chain data (e.g., what a transaction is, what its parameters mean, what type of asset it is, what purpose a smart contract serves). This forces AI developers to build custom data parsers for each specific dApp or data type.
- Complexity in Data Retrieval: AI models require structured and contextual data to learn and make predictions. Raw blockchain data does not provide this context directly, requiring complex steps to extract, transform, and enrich data off-chain before feeding it into AI models.
- Entry Barrier for AI Developers: Data scientists and AI engineers are often unfamiliar with blockchain data structures and Cardano's smart contract language (Plutus), creating a significant barrier that prevents them from developing AI applications that leverage Cardano's potential.
- Missed Potential: AI applications that need quick, flexible, and contextual data access to perform tasks such as market trend analysis, fraud detection, DeFi protocol optimization, or providing AI-based personalized financial services from Cardano data are being limited due to the lack of suitable infrastructure.

These issues increase development costs, delay innovation, limit application features, and put Cardano at risk of falling behind other blockchains that are developing better AI integration solutions.

## Our Solution: OpenMCP (Model Context Protocol) for Cardano
OpenMCP is an open standard protocol aimed at creating a seamless bridge between AI models and Cardano's on-chain data. It acts as an "intermediate brain" between AI/LLM applications and Cardano's complex data ecosystem. This solution will:

- Translate human requests into technical queries.
- Aggregate results from multiple sources.
- Most importantly, "contextualize" data before returning it.

The project will develop a comprehensive toolkit that allows AI developers to easily and securely integrate Cardano blockchain data into their applications.

## Key Features
OpenMCP for Cardano will include the following core components:

### Dedicated MCP Server for Cardano
Build one or more MCP Servers optimized to interact with the Cardano blockchain. These servers will use tools like cardano-db-sync or third-party APIs (Blockfrost, Maestro) to access on-chain data.

### AI-Ready Data Extraction & Normalization
Develop modules within the MCP Server capable of:

- Extracting various types of on-chain data: transactions, UTXO states, smart contract data (Plutus), native asset information (Native Assets/NFTs), Catalyst governance data, staking, etc.
- Converting and normalizing this raw data into structured, understandable, and consumable formats for AI models (e.g., JSON schemas, knowledge graphs, vector embeddings).

### Providing Cardano-specific "Resources," "Prompts," and "Tools"
- Resources: Provide queryable resources such as Plutus smart contract schemas, wallet address transaction history, NFT metadata, staking pool states.
- Prompts: Design optimized prompt templates for specific tasks on Cardano, helping LLM interactions be more effective (e.g., "Please summarize this wallet's DeFi activity", "Explain the logic of this Plutus contract").
- Tools: Build functions that AI can call to perform more complex actions or queries, for example: "check ADA balance of an address", "retrieve transaction history of a specific token", "validate transaction status", "create a valid Plutus transaction" (in later stages).

### Developer-Friendly Interface
Provide clear documentation, code examples, and client libraries (if needed) so AI developers can easily connect their applications, LLMs, and AI Agents to the OpenMCP Cardano Server.

### Proof of Concept (PoC) & Usage Guidelines
Develop a PoC to demonstrate OpenMCP's capability in querying Cardano data using LLMs and provide detailed guidelines for the community to deploy and use.

## Impact
OpenMCP for Cardano will have profound impacts on the Cardano ecosystem and AI community:

- Unlocking AI Potential on Cardano: Significantly reduce technical barriers to developing AI applications that leverage on-chain data, thereby promoting innovation and creating unique AI solutions on Cardano.
- Enhancing dApp Interoperability: Enable dApps on Cardano to create smarter AI features, such as user behavior analysis, DeFi strategy optimization, intelligent blockchain assistants, market predictions based on chain data, AI-optimized DAO governance, etc.
- Increasing Accessibility and Value of On-Chain Data: Transform Cardano's on-chain data from complex formats into easily understandable "context" that can be queried by AI, expanding the application scope of this data.
- Standardizing Data for AI: Ensure AI applications can interact with Cardano data consistently through a standard protocol, minimizing fragmentation.
- Enhancing Transparency and Monitoring: AI can be used to analyze and audit on-chain activities more effectively, enhancing transparency in the ecosystem and supporting network monitoring, risk detection, and performance optimization.
- Increasing ADA Value: By expanding use cases and utilities of on-chain data, OpenMCP will indirectly generate a large volume of transactions from dApps, users, and AI Agent bots for the Cardano ecosystem.

## Open Source & Licensing
All source code developed for OpenMCP will be released under the Apache 2.0 open source license. This ensures openness, transparency, and encourages community contributions. Protocol specifications, documentation, and schemas will also be provided publicly and free to use.

We believe keeping the project open will promote widespread adoption and maximize contributions to the Cardano ecosystem.

We commit to regularly updating the public source code repository on GitHub as the product develops under the Apache 2.0 license.

## Documentation
To ensure high-quality documentation, we will provide comprehensive documentation for both users and developers:

- README file (current): Will be the starting point, providing general introduction and quick guides to help users easily get started.
- GitBook page: Will be in-depth documentation, presenting detailed deployment steps, practical examples, and specific explanations for each feature.

All this documentation is built with clear structure, accompanied by illustrations and specific examples to ensure ease of understanding and accessibility.

## Getting Started (Coming Soon)
We will provide open source client libraries (supporting languages like Python and TypeScript) that allow AI models to easily integrate with MCP Server to query Cardano's on-chain data. Detailed guides will be available in our documentation.
